# Homework 1

## Assignment 1: Lab 1
Here are the relevant links for Lab 1.

[my Github](https://github.com/bensteers/), 
[my gittest repo](https://github.com/bensteers/gittest_bs3639), 
[neighborâ€™s gittest repo](https://github.com/yixuantang/yixuantang/), and 
[my fork](https://github.com/bensteers/yixuantang/).

I didn't receive any pull requests, but I created:
 * a branch
 * a conflict
 * a pull request
 * then merged with the master branch
 
 so hopefully that is sufficient.

## Assignment 2: Setup environment
This is a screenshot of my .bash_profile showing the requested alias/export declarations.
