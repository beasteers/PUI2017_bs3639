### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Ha: The change in BMI of people in the diet sample is higher than the change in BMI of people in the exercise sample after 1 year.

Ho: The average percent change in BMI of people in the diet sample is significantly lower than the average percent change in BMI of people in the exercise sample after X year(s).



**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimental setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Ha: The IQ of children whose parents smoked during pregnancy is lower than the ID of children whose parents did not smoke during pregnancy.

Ho: The average IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 whose parents smoked at least X cigarettes a day during pregnancy is the same as or higher than the average IQ of children whose parents did not smoke during pregnancy.



**Contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

Ha: The lack of access to healthy food contributes to the incidence of diabetes.

Ho: There is no correlation between the distribution of diabetes and the lack of access to healthy food in that location.


This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
