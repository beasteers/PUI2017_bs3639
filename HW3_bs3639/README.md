# Assignment 1
I communicated with Isha Chaturvedi on this assignment, though we both did our own work.

This assignment consisted of:
* Generating 100 samples with varying sample sizes (10 < N < 2000) using 5 different distributions
    * **Distributions**: Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Logistic, Chi Squared.
* Demonstrate Central Limit Theorem by plotting the sample means as a function of sample size.
* Plot the distribution of sample means as a histogram.
* Combine and plot the sample means of all distributions on a histogram.
* Fit a gaussian curve to the sample mean distribution.

# Assignment 2
I communicated with Isha Chaturvedi on this assignment, though we both did our own work.

This assignment consisted of:
* Loading CitiBike data for one month from Amazon Web Services.
* Formulating a null and alternative hypothesis to test.
* Displaying the data in both tabular and graphical formats.

Next assignment, the hypothesis will be tested.

# Assignment 3
I worked alone on this assignment.

**Finish Lab 3.**

A bus company wanted to compare new bus travel times with their existing travel times to see if there is any significant improvement. This notebook computes the one-tailed Z test to determine if the improvement is significant.
