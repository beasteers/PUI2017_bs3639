# Homework 4
## Assignment 1: Review your classmate's Citibike project proposal.
Peer review of Anupama Santhosh's [Cikibike assignment](https://github.com/bensteers/PUI2017_as11566/tree/master/HW3_as11566).


## Assignment 2: Literature choices of statistical tests.
Analyse 3 statistical tests from articles found in [PLOS ONE](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/). List their variables and types along with the hypothesis, research question, and statistical significance level. I worked alone on this assignment.

| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **|

## Assignment 3: Reproduce the analysis of the Hard to Employ program in NY.
Reproduce the analysis of the Hard to Employ programs for NY. I worked alone on this assignment.


## Assignment 4: Tests of correlation using the scipy package with citibike data.
Used the following are 3 tests to assess correlation between 2 samples of citibike data:
* K-S test
* Pearson’s test
* Spearman’s test

Use: trip duration of bikers that ride during the day vs night. State your result in words in terms of the Null Hypothesis

Use: age of bikers for trips originating in Manhattan and in Brooklyn. Use at least 2 months of citibike data. The citibike data can be accessed from the citibike website - make sure you do it in a reproducible way, or in the CUSP data facility at the path /gws/open/Student/citibike
