# PUI2017 HW 5.
## Assignment 1: Test the Z test: 
Test that the distribution of z-values follows a standard normal distribution, N(0,1), using a KS test.



## Assignment 2: Compare Tests for Goodness of fit
Test that binomial and Poisson distributions look increasingly more similar to Gaussians as the mean of the distribution increases.


## Assignment 3: US has a problem...
investigate linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries.

I worked with Emily Padvorac, Dana Reshef, and Becky Scheidegger on this assignment.

### Grading 
Usual grading scheme applies. Remember that succesfully fitting a line to data is not sufficient. Comment on what conclusions can be drawn from your analysis (and don't jump to conclusions!)
